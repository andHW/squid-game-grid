# Squid Game Grid

A simple web representation of the Squid Game Grid.

Designed to be responsive.

Just a POC, the code is inelegant.

## Config

See [main.js](main.js) to set the `NUM_OF_PLAYERS`.

Only 1 to 100 are tested.

## Ideas

- Save the state of the game to a cookie.
- Add squid game geometric shaped buttons (reset the game, toggle fullscreen, etc).
